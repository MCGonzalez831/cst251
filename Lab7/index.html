<p> The purpose of this lab is to further work,edit,and use CSS files.</p>

<h2>Challanges</h2>
<p> the main challeanges of this lab were mainly: How to change the font, edit
  the css file to add margins, change the color of backgorund and font, and
  edit the div section that has the image. </p>

<h2>Problems</h2>
<p> Problems that were encounted were: trying to fix the div and trying to make
  it fit into the picture and not have a long empty space. Trying to add
  margins to change the text and their postition but I wasn't sure where exactly
  to put them wihtout them messing up the text. I couldn't figure out certain
  things but I tired.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>

  plain white and boring. It still needs a lot of work but it helps me
  learn build experince and stylize my website.</p>
