   <h1>Lab 15: Fancy CSS I</h1>
<p>The purpose of this lab is to try and use more advanced and fancy css features
  such as using: text shadow, box shadow, gradients, rounded corners, object fit,
  and Trasnform.</p>

   <h2>Challenge</h2>
   <p> Challenges in this lab were mainly trying out the new elements tying to
      add the new fancy css elements. Some which I already knew how to use like
      the rounded corners, but not the rest. Most of them were pretty easy like
      the box shadow and text shadow. Adding the gradient was pretty fun but the
       main callange of this was figureing out the image in my last div content
       box since it wasn't working. Another main challange was trying to apply the
       trasnform.</p>

   <h2>Problems</h2>
   <p>Problems encountended in this lab were mainly not realizing that I did not
     put in my soruce for my image, which ment that I spend 1 hour of work trying
     fix it. Also I was not able to figure out how to use the transform tool properly.
     I tired using it and testing diffrent things with it but I just wasn't working.</p>

   <h2>Resutls</h2>
   <p>I have a very tacky looking website that took me a total of six hours to
       make. BUT I did learn new fancy css factors, all of them expct the transform
       since I did apply it but I don't see a diffrence. Also I did apply object
       but I don't know if it also changed anything, only diffrence I see is that
       the image was more fitted to the div box.
