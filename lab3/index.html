    <h1> Lab 3 File Structures</h1>
    <p>I am not sure if I am supposed to put down what Wes put down but I am going
    to. The point of this lab is to creat a local file structre on my computer
    and creat an index table to link local .html files. </p>
    <h2>Challanges</h2>
    <p> It took me forever to put in the picture because for somereason it wasn't working.
      I've spent 2 days trying to add in the picture and now in class it finally worked.
    Now I just need to link it.</p>
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p> This the index page (that I hope works because, again I have spent to
      much time on this page and I am pretty upset about this). Will edit This
      after comfirmation that it works.</p>
