  <p id="orange-one"> the purpose of this lab it to futher expriment with CSS
    selctors, by editing them, changing the font, margins, color, etc.</p>

    <p> And will the div.callout work as well? yes, yes it did.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="special"> Now wil the p.special work</p>

    <h2>Challanges</h2>
    <p> Trying to change the colors by using the selectors, not really
      understanding the CSS inheritance part that much, and still trying to add
      and change fonts/margins. Also I didn't realize I had to write the code
      here too so it took way longer. </p>

    <h2>Problems</h2>
    <p>There were a lot of problems in this Lab. Way too many. I still wasn't
      able fix the margins properly, or the div content sizing issue. Another
      big problem I had was trying to add the CSS selectors I was tyring
      to change the color and font of the heading and paragrah, but it wasn't
      letting me. Also like I said above, I didn't realize that I had to wirte
      the code here to change the color instead of just typing it in the CSS
      file.  Overall, it took a long time to fix.</p>

    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>For results, I have this atourius looking website. I mean it was diffuclt
    and becuae it is currently 10:45pm on and I have a terrible sleeping
    schedule, I will fix this later. This lab was fun even withs its problems
    but hopefully I can get better at it.     </p>
