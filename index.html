	<p>Hello, My name is Mirna Gonzalez and this is my website for CST251!
			I am currently a 3rd year student as Califonia State Universtiy Monterey Bay.
			I just recently switched majors from Visual and Pubic Arts to Communication Design.
			My reason for changing is beacuse VPA wasn't really offerting much for me and
			for I wanted in my career, for example: There weren't any digital art classes
			and I rally wanted to learn how to do to use editing programs like Photoshop,
			Illustrator, etc. not only for the sake of knowing them but also due to
			further my art and grahic design skills.</p>

			<p>I currently live in Santa Cruz County with my 2 dogs and 3 cats, getting
			ready to move in with my partner soon. </p>
