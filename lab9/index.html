  <h1>Lab 9: Styling Block Elements</h1>
  <p> The purpose of this lab is to experiment styling block element. Such as
    furter experimentation with div content, margins, padding, adding borders,
    color, and styling the page and images.</p>

  <h2>Challanges</h2>
  <p>The main challanges of this lab were mainly and still once again tyring to
    fix and experiment with margins, image allignment, trying diffrent border
    options. Still not a perfect website by no means and with a lot of Problems
    but still a lot of fun doing it. Mostly. </p>


  <h2>Problems</h2>
  <p>The problems I had in this lab were not being able to fix the captaion and
    make it be aligned and under the picture. The div content still looks weird
    when the bower window is small, but then too big when the window is fully
    open.</p>

  <p>Another problem was that when I wanted to make a seprate div content for my
    image it just overlaped with this one. Also I really wanted to give space
    in between my pharagrahs and the picture but I didn't know how to.</p.>

  <h2>Results</h2>
  <p>While there were a lot of challanges and problems, and my website stills
    looks very amature, but it is an imporvement.</p>
