<h1> Lab 4 File Transfer</h1>
<p> The subject of this lab was to test local files from my computer and upload
    them into the server.</p>
<h2> Challanges</h2>
<p>The only challages that happend during this lab were: initaly tring to get
	 into the zoom call with my partner for this lab, Brooke, but then we manged
	 to make it work after starting a new call. Now the second challage was trying
	 to figure upload my files into the server throught Github. But that was solved easily, as
   Brooke helped me though that.</P>
	<h2>Results</h2>
	<p>What I learned from this lab was how to upload local files from my PC into
	   the server. Mainly how to upload my files to Github and then publishing
	   the files into an actual website. </P>
