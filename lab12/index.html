      <h1>Lab 12: Advanched Block-Level Styling II </h1>
<p>The puruse of this lab is to now experiment with sertain styling blocks
   such as fitting images, aligning them, and cnetering them. Along with text.</p>
<p> I am tired.</p>
<p> I will fix this later beacsue it is almost 2 am and I am very tired becasue
  this lab just didn't want to work. Despite me doing exactly what I did
  last time for the pervious lab.</p>
