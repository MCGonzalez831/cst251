<h1>Lab 10: Styling Text Elements</h1>
  <p> The purpose of this lab is to now experiment with diffrent fonts for our
    text and see if they work both in our bower and in the web.</p>

    <h2>Challanges</h2>
    <p>Challanges of this lab were trying to find fonts that we could use, that
    aren't the most basic of fonts. Another challenge was tyring to implement
    said fonts. Which was a struggle.</p>

    <h2>Problems</h2>
    <p>I have too many problems already. But lab wise, a big problem was, as
    mentioned earlier, tyring to add those said fonts. Also the font covered up
    my orginal title and even after I went back and fixed it, it still wasn't
    working. Also captaion still needs work.</p>

    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>Once again, I have a better looking website and learned how to put new
    non-boring, non-basic, fonts. </p>
