  <h1>Lab 11: Advanced Block-Level I</h1>
  <p> The purpouse of this lab is to experiment with more advanced types of
    block styling. For this lab were finally emplemanting the sidebar and still
    trying experimenting with the div content. </p>

    <h2>Challanges</h2>
  <p> I really need to make my own merch. what if I write stuff with it go all
     the way until it hits the picture and then go below it or will it still
     hit and go under the picture?? </p>

    <h2>Problems</h2>
  <p>what went wrong? A lot of things did for this. Why can't I change the figcaptaions
     on here still!?!? :( trying to make a list order for my facts and no format worked until I found one
     on w3schools. </p>

    <h2>Results</h2>
  <p>This website looks a little better but becasue I am writting this on
   October 7th, after the lectrue I have to go back and fix this. Since its not
   what Wes wants, I still have to seprate it. Also I still coudn't add a background
   image, this is something both me and my partner strugged a lot with. Overall,
   this lab is pretty difficlut. </p>

    <p>Now will it work too?? I mean it kinda did but then there is this big ass
      gap in between here and the next sentance. I think it was beasue the line
      limit that is here in the code and not because of the picture. By the way,
      this is filler text so I know if it worked or not.</p>

    <p>Update: I did!</p>
