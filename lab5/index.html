		<h1> Lab 5 More HTML</h1>
		<p>The purpose of this lab is to creat basic HTML web pages with images
		and links to other pages.</p>
		<h2>Challanges</h2>
		<p>The main challages that happend were: 1. Trying to figure out how to
			link my webpages on atom but after posting on Slack and getting an
		example there, I finally linked my pages. Now 2. Was trying to figure
		out how to link my Instagram link. Because for some reason the twitter link
		worked fine, but not instagram. I tired to change and teak the code but
		nothing worked until I moved the links from the top of the page to the
		bottom of the page, just above the pictures. </p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>I finally got a working page with links and avalibale pictures. Now this
		page has links to both my Instagram and Twitter pages. My Instagram page has
		all my art (examples under this), while my twitter not so much. I mainly use it as a moodboard.</p>
