	<h1>Lab 6 More Complicated HTML</h1>
	<p> The purpose of this lab is to expirment more with html, add imput,
		link css files.</p>
		<h2>Challanges</h2>
		<p> Took me forever to figure out how to fix the code because it came output
			very uneven. It took me half of the entire day to finally fix it. After that
		it took me 2 hours and half a day later to finally figure out how to link the
	  css index page to give it a theme. Think it was beause I was putting Ref instead
    of rel. But I finally worked. </p>
		<h2>Results</h1>
			<p> Now I can inset polls with options, how to put in a submit option bar,
				and how to link a css file, to actually give my website a theme.</p>
