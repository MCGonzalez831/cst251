<h1>Lab 13:Typograhy 1</h1>
<p>The purpose of this lab this to now experiment with Typograhy by taking a website
  and creating a fake version of it using elemetns that we've already learned and
  applying them to this lab. The point is to creat a close enhougn replica of the
  website image.</p>

  <h2>Challanges</h2>
  <p>The main challanges of this lab were mainly trying to add our downloaded font
    that matched the picture font exactly but we coudn't so we had to find a google one
    that while it wasn't perfect, it worked. Another big challange was trying to
    add our picture sine its not a background image interley and also how to make
    it it into the div i frame box. A big final challange for my anyway was that
    I wanted to change the colors on my nav so it would better match the theme but
    it wasn't letting me for some reason.</p>

  <h2>Problems</h2>
  <p>Just like before, everylab has its problems but this time both me and my partner
    really struggeled with this lab. One of the biggest problem was the font issue.
    We also encounted was that we weren't able to get the images to lign up exactly
    right and it just looks weird. Also, the didn't work in my favour. As mentioned above, us not being
    able to link the pages toghers so one could look at the fake from the html index.
</p>

  <h2>Resualts</h2>
  <p>I have manged to somewhat copy the page as best as I could, the font nor picture
  is perfect but I think it looks acceptable maybe even better. Overall I can now put a preview
  for a diffrent page, and we learned how to align thigs better. It was deffinetly a
  process. </p>
