<h1>Lab 13:Typograhy 1</h1>
<p>The purpose of this lab this to now experiment with Typograhy by taking a website
  and creating a fake version of it using elemetns that we've already learned and
  applying them to this lab. The point is to creat a close enhougn replica of the
  website image.</p>

  <h2>Challanges</h2>

trying to add the picture, fixing the links, trying to fix the fake page becuse
certain colors don't show up. etc.
